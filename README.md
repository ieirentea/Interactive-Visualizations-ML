# Interactive-Visualizations-ML
This repository includes interactive visualizations designed to teach machine learning, specifically gradient descent and PCA. The visualizations are included in two jupyter notebooks introducing gradient descent and PCA.

The notebooks were created to be used in scientific research looking into the effect of interactive visualizations in teaching machine-learning topics.

The gradient descent notebook includes 3 interactive visualizations:
- one visualization for a scenario with one variable, where the user can change the starting value, learning rate, used function, number of iterations displayed, and whether the gradient of the last update is displayed graphically
- one visualization for a scenario with 6 variables, where the user can manually change the variables to minimize the error based on the gradients displayed
- one visualization for a scenario with 2 variables, where the user can choose the starting point, learning rate, and number of epochs

The PCA notebook includes 3 other interactive visualizations:
- one visualization displaying the effect of changing the slope of the selected line on the variance and reconstruction error
- one visualization displaying the effect of scaling the two dimensions of a dataset on the principal components
- one visualization displaying the effect of applying the covariance matrix transformation
